I have been tasked by DeliveryHero with a mission to implement a simple car racing game with the following rules/features:  

## Features

1. Accept user input for car names (comma-separated) and number of rounds.
2. Validate the input from user (car names should not exceed 5 characters, number of rounds must be greater than 0).
3. Each car moves forward or stays stationary based on a randomly generated number.
4. We display progress of cars in each round.
5. We find and display winner(s) when the game ends.
6. We handle user invalid input by throwing an IllegalArgumentsException
